R script Eisen DLBCL 

identify 2 distinct forms of DLBCL that indicate different stages of B-cell differentiation
using expression profiling and hierarchical clustering 


Calculate the pooled variance, and calculate the minimum sample size necessary to detect a 1.5 fold difference (at 80% power and 99% confidence).

Calculate the sample size required for the selected gene using the empirically determined delta between the two groups, assuming 99% confidence and 80% power.

Load the ssize and gdata libraries, calculate the standard deviation for each gene in the matrix, and plot a histogram of the standard deviations. 

Calculate and plot a proportion of genes vs. sample size graph to get an idea of the number of genes that have an adequate sample size for confidence=95%, effect size=3 (log2 transform for the function), and power=80%.
