# statisticalAnalysisPipeline
Statistical analysis pipeline using R and Bioconductor to identify discriminant genes in a microarray dataset

-Test for outlier samples and provide visual proof

-Filter out genes that have low expression values using criterion CVs < 5%

-Feature selection with two-sample test – Retain genes with pv < .05

-Visualize the samples in two-dimensional space using dimensionality reduction methods

-Classify the samples using LDA

-Identify gene information for the top 5 discriminant genes
