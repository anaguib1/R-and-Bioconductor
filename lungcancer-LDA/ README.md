R script  lung cancer data 

identifying transcripts that are both differentially expressed 
between different cancer types and normal tissue and can be subsequently used to 
classify unknown tissue into the appropriate cancer type


calculate linear discriminant analysis (LDA)

train a model on a subset of the arrays,
then test the predictability of this model on the remaining arrays, for identifying the
correct cancer (and normal) class
